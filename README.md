## Inspiration
Learn, Apply, Execute. Since my hobby includes movie and animations, I took it as an inspiration to create a website and enjoyed it. Better design was made in Second Index HTML template project. I shared this repository to share my early journey as I enter the IT industry. I'm not ashamed to share this since this is my first step which gave me motivation and dream to be a web developer. Comparing the poor code structure of the first Web page with my recent repo in Gitlab tells me how much I improve from my first week journey upto today.
